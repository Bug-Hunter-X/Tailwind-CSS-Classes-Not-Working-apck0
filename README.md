# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly.  The problem is likely due to an issue in your Tailwind configuration, a path issue or a problem with your build process. The solution involves verifying your Tailwind setup, including the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js`, ensuring the correct CSS output path, and confirming your HTML correctly uses Tailwind classes.

## Bug

The provided `index.html` file uses the `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes from Tailwind CSS. However, these classes do not apply the expected styling.

## Solution

The solution includes fixing the possible `content` array  and checking your build process.
